Get your access token:

  * [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nylas.com)

  * Click "Accounts" in the left hand side of the dashboard.

  * Click the big blue button "Auth Account".

  * Enter your email address from the service you want. 

Google Gmail example:

  * We are connecting to Google, so we enter our Google Gmail address, "alice@example.com".

  * The browser shows "Sign in with Google. Choose an account to continue to nylas.com".

  * Click our account.

  * The browser shows "This app isn't verified. This app hasn't been verified by Google yet. Only proceed if you know and trust the developer."

  * Click "Advanced".

  * Click "Go to nylas.com (unsafe)".

Permissions:

  * The browser shows "Grant nylas.com permission: Read, compose, send, and permanently delete all your email from Gmail"

  * Click "Allow".

  * The browser shows "Grant nylas.com permission: See, edit, download, and permanently delete your contacts"

  * Click "Allow".

  * The browser says "Grant nylas.com permission. See, edit, share, and permanently delete all the calendars you can access using Google Calendar"

  * Click "Allow".

  * The browser shows "Confirm your choices".

  * Click "Allow".

Nylas dashboard:

  * The browser shows the Nylas dashboard.

  * The browser shows a banner at top, such as "Account added for alice@example.com. Access token: ecSbNjMEShnGsJYhovyFxgVSWYwt88".

  * Copy the access token somewhere safe, because it only shows up this one time. 

  * If you lose the access token, then you must re-authenticate the account and get a new access token.
