# Contact Open Source with Nylas API integration

This project is a starting point for Contact Open Source developers to learn about the Nylas API integration service, which can connect to contact management resources provided by Google (such as Gmail), Microsoft (such as Exchange), etc.

## Introduction

This repo currently demonstrates sample code to connect to Nylas, then to Google, then to fetch a user's contacts.

The sample code is based on the Nylas guides, and comes in three programming langauges: Node, Python, and Ruby.

We welcome code and feedback, such as new sample features, new implementations in other programming languages, and any advice on how to improve.


## Setup

Start with these two help pages:

  * [nylas_google_integration](doc/nylas_google_integration.md)

  * [nylas_account_access_token](doc/nylas_account_access_token.md)

The Nylas website has good guides that go into more depth, and provide more options. 


## Run the code

The sample code is within the `/bin` directory:

  * [nylas-demo-with-node.mjs](bin/nylas-demo-with-node/nylas-demo-with-node.mjs)

  * [nylas-demo-with-python.py](bin/nylas-demo-with-python/nylas-demo-with-python.py)

  * [nylas-demo-with-ruby.rb](bin/nylas-demo-with-ruby/nylas-demo-with-ruby.rb)

Each sample code file includes comments that describe how to run it, such as how to install dependencies, how to configure environment variables, etc.
